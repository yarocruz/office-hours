# Office Hours

Remember that in order to absorb and keep up with the firehose of material you'll be exposed to, you should at least dedicate a minimum of **20 hours per week** on the material. This is extra time from the 9 hours of class lectures through zoom. Your mileage may vary, but the idea is to reinforce and recall what your learning. 

Also make sure to (book time with a tutor)[https://calendly.com/d/dnc-wpf-c7s], even if you don't think you'll need one. Trust us, a lot of ya'll will need one.

Finally, make sure to come to Office Hours if you need help and have questions. 

Office hours are always before the the class lectures from **5:45pm to 6:30pm and 9:30pm to 10:00pm Eastern Time**
