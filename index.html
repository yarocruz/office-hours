        <h1>Office Hours</h1>

        <h2>Monday, Wednesday, Thursday: 545pm to 6:30pm and 9:30pm to 10:00pm</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>Remember that in order to absorb and keep up with the firehose of material you'll be exposed to, you should
            at least dedicate a minimum of <strong>20 hours per week</strong> on the material. This is extra time from
            the 9 hours of class lectures through zoom. Your mileage may vary, but the idea is to reinforce and recall
            what your learning.
        </p>
        <p>Also make sure to <a href="https://calendly.com/d/dnc-wpf-c7s" target="_blank">book time with a tutor</a>,
            even if you don't think you'll
            need one. Trust us, a lot of ya'll will need one.
        </p>

            Finally, make sure to come to Office Hours if you need help and have questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Office hours are always before the the class lectures from <strong>5:45pm to 6:30pm and 9:30pm to 10:00pm
